## Description

The **Paladin Operator** is a Kubernetes operator designed to manage Paladin nodes within a Kubernetes cluster. It automates the deployment, configuration, and management of Paladin instances, providing a seamless experience for operators and developers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go** version **v1.22+**
- **Docker** version **17.03+**
- **Gradle** version **6.0+**
- **kubectl** version **v1.11.3+**
- **Kind** (Kubernetes in Docker) installed
- **Helm** version **v3+**
- **GNU Make**

---

## Getting Started

### One-Click Installation with Gradle

For convenience, you can run the entire setup with a single Gradle command:

```sh
gradle deploy
```

This command performs all the necessary steps to deploy the Paladin Operator and create a functional Paladin node:

- **Builds** both the Paladin and Operator Docker images.
- **Starts** the Kind cluster.
- **Loads** the images into the cluster.
- **Installs** Helm CRDs.
- **Installs** the operator using Helm.
- **Verifies** the operator is running in the `paladin` namespace.
- **Creates** the Paladin nodes (Besu Node and Paladin Node).

**Note:** This is the quickest way to get everything up and running.

**Cleanup**

```
gradle clean
```

> This will not delete the cluster. Delete the cluster by running `make kind-delete`

---

### Manual Installation Steps

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to build and deploy the Paladin Operator and Paladin nodes in a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind.

#### Step 1: Build the Paladin and Operator Images

Navigate to the **parent directory** of the project (where the `build.gradle` file is located) and run:

```sh
gradle docker
```

This command will:

- Build the **Paladin** Docker image.
- Build the **Operator** Docker image.

**Note:** The `docker` task in the Gradle build script orchestrates the building of both images.

#### Step 2: Start the Kind Cluster

Create a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind:

```sh
make kind-start
```

This command will create a Kind cluster named `paladin` (as specified in the `Makefile`).

#### Step 3: Load the Images into the Kind Cluster

Load the Paladin and Operator images into the Kind cluster:

```sh
make kind-promote
```

This command loads the necessary Docker images into the Kind cluster so they can be used by Kubernetes deployments.

#### Step 4: Install Helm CRDs

Install the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required by the operator:

```sh
make install-crds
```

This uses Helm to install the CRDs defined in the operator's Helm chart.

#### Step 5: Install the Operator Using Helm

Deploy the Paladin Operator to the cluster:

```sh
make helm-install
```

This command will:

- Install the operator into the `paladin` namespace.
- Create the namespace if it doesn't exist.
- Set the operator's namespace appropriately.

#### Step 6: Verify the Operator is Running

Ensure the operator is running correctly in the `paladin` namespace:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n paladin
```

You should see output similar to:

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
paladin-operator-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          XXm
```

#### Step 7: Create a Functional Paladin Node

Now that the operator is running, you can create the Paladin nodes.

Create the nodes (Besu Node and Paladin Node):

```sh
make create-node
```

This command will:

- Create a **Besu Genesis** ConfigMap.
- Create a **Besu Node** instance and related resources.
- Create a **Paladin Node** instance and related resources.

#### Step 8: Verify the Nodes are Running

Check the status of the nodes:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n paladin
```

You should see output similar to:

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
besu-node-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx          1/1     Running   0          XXm
paladin-node-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxx       1/1     Running   0          XXm
```

This confirms that the Paladin and Besu nodes are successfully deployed and running.

## Cleanup

To remove the operator and clean up all resources from your cluster, run:

```sh
gradle clean
```

This command will:

- Delete all Paladin instances.
- Uninstall the operator Helm chart.
- Uninstall the CRDs.
- Clean up any build artifacts from your local environment.

**Note:** The `clean` task in the Gradle build script depends on the `cleanCluster` task, which invokes `make clean` to perform the cleanup.

---

## Development

### Building the Operator

To build the operator binary:

```sh
make build
```

### Running the Operator Locally

To run the operator locally (outside the cluster):

```sh
make run
```

This is useful for development and debugging purposes.

### Testing

Run unit tests:

```sh
make test
```

Run end-to-end tests:

```sh
make test-e2e
```

### Linting

Run linters to ensure code quality:

```sh
make lint
```

Automatically fix lint issues:

```sh
make lint-fix
```
